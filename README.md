# Polynomial-Expansion
This is a simple cuda course-project to compute the polynomial of a function.

The detailed description of the project is in the pdf file and the source codes for GPU and CPU are in polynomial_gpu.cu and polynomial.cpp files. The Makefile can be used to build code, generate tables and schedule jobs on the cluster.
